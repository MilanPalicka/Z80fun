# Z80fun
Learning fun project about Z80-CPU and Z80 peripherals.

Testing Z80-CPU only with a clock generator and forces NOP instruction to all addresses. I use an old Germany clone of the CPU - UB880D (f max=2,5MHz and some original undocumented instructions in compare to Zilog). If on the A15 pin of CPU are impulses with frequency f=CLK/65536 (28,125 Hz in this case), then the CPU seems to be OK.
